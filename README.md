### üîë Secret Key Implementation

<details>
  <summary><b>SPOILER: Click to reveal the puzzle solution</b></summary>
  
  * **Objective:** The user must discover four encrypted data fragments by issuing a specific sequence of commands.
  * **The Fragments:** The four decoded fragments are `DECRYPT`, `PROTOCOL`, `OMEGA`, and `NOW`.
  * **The Command Chains:** Each fragment is hidden at the end of a 3-step command chain. For example, to find the "DECRYPT" fragment, the user must:
      1.  First, type `/scan_network`.
      2.  The AI will respond with a clue about a frequency. The user must then type `/isolate_frequency 77.5`.
      3.  The AI will respond with a clue about a data packet. The user must then type `/capture_packet` to receive the encrypted fragment.
  * **Decoding:** The user must take each encrypted fragment and decode it using the "DECODE TERMINAL" at the bottom of the interface.
  * **Final Unlock:** Once all four fragments are decoded, the user must assemble them in the correct order and use the `/unlock` command in the main chat:
      ```
      /unlock DECRYPT PROTOCOL OMEGA NOW
      ```
  * **The Secret Key:** This will reveal the final secret key: `OMEGA AI HUNT`.
